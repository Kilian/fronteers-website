For the Fronteers Conference Committee, we are looking for 3 new volunteers!

The conference committee is seeking new members who want to help organize the next Fronteers Conference and commit to organizing the 2024 conference.

## What will you do?

For the past few years, some of the logistics for the conference have been outsourced. This means that committee volunteers spend less time arranging locations, decorations, and scheduling. What remains is finding and inviting speakers, managing marketing and communication via our social media (in consultation with the Fronteers marketing committee), and recruiting and organizing the crew of volunteers who assist during the conference.

In recent years, the committee has seen several changes, which is why we are now looking for new members who are willing to roll up their sleeves during this conference, and next year, take over from some of the current committee members!

## What do we expect from our volunteers?

As a volunteer at Fronteers, you are part of an active, young association. The best way to network and gain new skills!

-   A commitment of at least one year, dedicating a maximum of 2 hours per week to the association – observing for a month or two is no problem.
-   Team players who know how to take action (or are willing to ask for help when needed!)
-   A critical eye; do you see things we can do better or make more fun/beautiful as an association? We’d love to hear it!

## Interested?
