Fronteers is actively looking for new board members and volunteers who, like us, find it important to support front-end developers in the Netherlands in their work, by facilitating knowledge sharing and networking events.

-   The current board consists of three enthusiastic volunteers who take care of the day-to-day operations of the association:
    -   maintaining the member administration
    -   arranging discount deals for members
    -   supporting and assisting committees
    -   volunteer management and coordination

Additionally, this year we are being extra ambitious by tackling the identity of the association through multiple identity sessions. We also want to work on a new website for Fronteers (and possibly for the conference).

We are looking for someone with vision and drive, who enjoys not only brainstorming about new initiatives but also rolling up their sleeves to help ensure they are realized (with or without the help of volunteers and committees).
We are also looking for someone who is interested in eventually taking on or supplementing the role of chairperson, secretary, or treasurer.

As a volunteer at Fronteers, you are part of an active, young association. The best way to network and gain new skills!

## What do we expect from our volunteers?

-   A commitment of at least one year, dedicating a maximum of 2 hours per week to the association – observing for a month or two is no problem.
-   Team players who know how to take action (or are willing to ask for help when needed!)
-   A critical eye; do you see things we can do better or make more fun/beautiful as an association? We’d love to hear it!

## Interested?
