As Fronteers, we would like to regularly organize high-quality meetings and activities in the Netherlands, where front-enders can meet and learn from each other. At the moment, we don’t have the capacity to organize much. That’s why we are looking for enthusiastic volunteers for the Activities Committee!

We are looking for a few real go-getters for this committee who enjoy networking and inspiring others! Do you have that skill? Then contact us via an email to [bestuur@fronteers.nl](mailto:bestuur@fronteers.nl)!

## What does being a volunteer for this committee entail?

-   As a member of the Activities Committee, you will organize events such as social gatherings, knowledge-sharing meetings, or meetings at host companies with presentations by speakers.
-   Information about topics, speakers, and locations is available. We are looking for a committee member to use this information to organize several meetings per year for both members and non-members of Fronteers.
-   It’s important that you are willing to think along, actively participate, and step in if one of the team members needs to prioritize other matters. The time commitment depends on the number of events you organize.

## What do we expect from our volunteers?

As a volunteer at Fronteers, you are part of an active, young association. The best way to network and gain new skills!

-   A commitment of at least one year, dedicating a maximum of 2 hours per week to the association – observing for a month or two is no problem.
-   Team players who know how to take action (or are willing to ask for help when needed!)
-   A critical eye; do you see things we can do better or make more fun/beautiful as an association? We’d love to hear it!
