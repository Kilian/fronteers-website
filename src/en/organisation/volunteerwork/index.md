Fronteers is looking for new volunteers to help achieve the ambitious plans we have as an association. Will you help?

Below you will find a number of committees for which we are currently looking for people. You can sign up for or request information about a specific position by sending an email to [bestuur@fronteers.nl](mailto:bestuur@fronteers.nl)!

## What do we expect from new volunteers?

- A commitment of at least one year to dedicate a maximum of 2 hours per week to the association â€“ Watching and learning for a month or two is no problem
- Team players who know how to take initiative (or who are willing to ask for help if they need it!)
- A critical eye; do you see things we could do better or make more fun/beautiful as an association? We would love to hear about it!
