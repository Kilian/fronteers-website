In the years that Fronteers has existed, it has gained valuable knowledge and collected resources. We want to share that knowledge and resources with the front-end community in the Netherlands and Belgium.

## Who are the knowledge and resources available for?

Meetings, user groups, meetups, and events that help professionalize the occupation of front-end web developer. This can be both direct and indirect, applying to both new initiatives and established groups.

## What is available?

Various presentation technology equipment, such as an HD projector and two HD cameras with separate microphones. It is also possible to have a logo printed on stickers or pens.

In terms of knowledge, Fronteers could assist in finding a speaker or presenter. It is also possible to co-brand an event, bringing together two groups of professionals.

If a location needs to be found, we can help by finding a company that can act as a host. If we can't find one together, a venue can also be rented.

On our [events page](/bijeenkomsten), a link to interesting activities can be posted.

It is also possible to submit an open proposal. In that case, Fronteers could pay the invoice for a product or service you specify.

If you are a member of Fronteers, it is, of course, also possible to organize the activity fully under the Fronteers banner. We are open to all initiatives!

## What are the conditions?

Support requires a thorough answer to the question "How do you support the professionalization of the front-end developer profession?"

The use of the equipment needs to be scheduled and requires the time and commitment of our own volunteers. Therefore, it is advisable to plan a meetup as far in advance as possible, preferably at least _two weeks in advance_. In general, the earlier, the better.

Additionally, it is appreciated if Fronteers is mentioned as a partner and/or if there are some Fronteers stickers available for visitors to take.

## Sounds good, how do I get in touch with you?
