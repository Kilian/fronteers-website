The Fronteers community is best found online on Slack. [Sign up right away](https://join.slack.com/t/fronteersnl/shared_invite/zt-1m0mbjbkh-LyrZgCPr1JzWBeASuTcnog) and join us for a chat about everything related to front-end development, or read the [blog post](/nl/blog/2016/02/fronteers-op-slack.html) for more information.

You can also find us on Mastodon via [@fronteers](https://front-end.social/@fronteers). Questions and comments via those media are welcome.

Of course, you can also contact [the board](/nl/vereniging/bestuur) or [the committees](/nl/vereniging/commissies) via email. Choose the subject that best fits your question or comment; your message will then be forwarded directly to the right person.
