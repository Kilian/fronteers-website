There will, unfortunately, be no Fronteers Conference this year.

With a very heavy heart, we have to inform you that we aren't able to hold our 14th conference.

Despite a big marketing push in the last few weeks, we needed to sell more tickets to make it possible for us to hold this year's conference. Unfortunately, we are still far from the break-even point, and projections suggest we won't be able to reach it. So we decided to cancel now before needing to make huge financial commitments to vendors like catering and the venue itself. The financial risk would have been too big to continue. We've extremely sorry as you might already have booked flights or hotels, but the decision was unavoidable and certainly not made lightly.

Thank you so much for your support for everyone who bought a ticket! It really means a lot. And we are very sorry we can't keep our side of the deal. We will refund your ticket as soon as possible. We've already instructed Tito to set things in motion, but it might take a few days to a week or two before the banks transfer the money back to you. We will keep an eye on the process to ensure everyone gets a full refund. If you have yet to receive your refund after two weeks, please let us know, and we'll try to find out what happened.

What this means for the future of the Fronteers Conference, we don't know. If something changes, we will definitely let you know.
