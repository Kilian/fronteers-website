We're back! The infamous [Fronteers Entertainment Squadâ„¢](https://twitter.com/frontcheers) (or as some like to call them: the 'Toxic Twins') has been training for months to host the second edition of FrontCheers ðŸ’«  .  If you were lucky enough to attend last year's edition, you may be excited to hear that this FrontCheers ðŸ’« ã€€2017 is going to be even better.

From Async to â€™N Sync. Join us the evening before the conference for Party Extravaganza Conference Kickoffâ„¢ at FrontCheers ðŸ’« â€ƒ .

## Tell me, what is FrontCheers ðŸ’«ã€€?

There will obviously be ample time for drinks and chats - so you can catch up with old and new friends. But weâ€™re also going to challenge you a bit. We will ask you some questions, where your knowledge of webdevelopment or some Fronteers history might come in handy. And how about your expertise of â€˜N Sync? There will be a bit gaming going on, and a lot of show!

But, no pressure! We realise you all have two heavy days coming up, so plenty of time to relax as well. We have a nice selection of the finest soft drinks so you can start the day fresh & fruity on Thursday (and yes, if you prefer, we also have beer). Whatever happens: your hosts for the evening Peter van Grieken & Charis Rooda will make sure this will be the highlight of the conference. ðŸ‘¯ (ask the people who were there last year, it's true)

Do you happen to be in town early? No problem, we have thought of that!
If you're in town early, you can join us for a [shared dinner](https://goo.gl/Y991pr) for 20 euros. Let us know when you register and we will make the reservation for you.

## Hope to meet you all at FrontCheers ðŸ’« ! ðŸ‘¬ðŸ‘«ðŸ‘­
