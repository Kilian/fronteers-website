# Setting up your perfect build system

All modern websites and web applications require a build step in which we compile, compress and clean any code/assets in our project.

Gulp.js is a task runner that allows us to quickly create and customize build systems for any type of project. Whether you are building a Ruby on Rails application, creating an App in Angular.js or a website on WordPress, learning Gulp is an investment you need to make.

# What you'll learn

This one day course will increase your web tooling workflow by taking a deep dive into Gulp.js. Not only will you be extremely comfortable with creating streaming build systems, you

The goals of this course are:

* Full understanding of Gulp, with the ability to create totally customized build systems
* Increased Developer Efficiency - build it once and have your tooling support you in solving problems rather than manual tasks
* Creation of better, cleaner codebases
* Faster loading websites, smaller overall footprints

## CSS

* Compiling Sass, Stylus or Less into CSS
* Start using CSS4 features today CSS Next
* Automatically prefixing CSS with Autoprefixer
* Removing unused CSS from our projects

## JavaScript

* Start writing next-generation ECMAScript 6 features today and _transpile_ into browser supported ES5 with Babel.js
* Concatenate, Compress and Obfuscate JavaScript into a single file
* Work with Sourcemaps for easy debugging on compressed and transpiled JavaScript files

## Code Quality + Performance

* Compress all your JPG, PNG and GIF files before launching a site
* Inline SVG files for easy manipulation and fast loading
* Run Linters on languages which check for coding errors

## The Toolchain

* Installing Node.js
* Managing packages with NPM
* Working with existing gulp build systems
* Creating build systems from scratch
* Selecting files with Globs
* Working with Buffers and Streams

## + So much more

* Live edit with BrowserSync to easily test, reload and sync website changes across multiple devices
* Compile Jade or Haml templates and partials into HTML
* Create watch that run when files are changed
* Error Handling and Desktop Notifications
* Writing your own Gulp.js Task

# Prerequisites

This course will take you from beginner to expert. No previous experience in Gulp is needed. Since Gulpfiles are written in JavaScript, some experience with JavaScript is an asset.

# Preparation

* A computer running OSX, Windows or Linux is required.
* A text editor - Sublime Text, TextMate, Coda, NotePad++, Vim...
* [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) or Terminal for Macs, [Cmdr](http://gooseberrycreative.com/cmder/) for Windows. Check out <http://CommandLinePowerUser.com> for some useful vids on getting comfortable in the terminal.
