Looking forward to Fronteers Conference 2016? And in town the evening before the conference kicks off? We’re going to do things a little different this year, but don’t worry, it will still be hot and steamy: We’re excited to announce FrontCheers!, the event to kick off Fronteers Conference.

## What will it be like?

There will obviously be ample time for drinks and chats - so you can catch up with old and new friends. But we’re also going to challenge you a bit. We will ask you some questions, where your knowledge of webdevelopment or some Fronteers history might come in handy. And how about your expertise of ‘N Sync? (so we can endorse you afterwards on LinkedIn). There will be a bit gaming going on, and a lot of show!

But, no pressure! We realise we all have two heavy days coming up, so plenty of time to relax as well. Whatever happens: your hosts for the evening Peter van Grieken & Charis Rooda will make sure this will be the highlight of the conference. 👯

## Hope to meet you all at FrontCheers! 👬👫👭
