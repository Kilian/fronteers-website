(Hidden)

We offer live transcription of all talks at our conference. A team of specialised stenographers will be transcribing the talks for you in English. Transcriptions will be shown on an extra, 80‚Äù screen installed on the theatre stage.

This way, we aim to make the conference more accessible, and to make following along with our excellent speakers even more comfortable for everyone.
