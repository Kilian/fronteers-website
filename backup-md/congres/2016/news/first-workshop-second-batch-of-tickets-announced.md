Published on Wednesday, June 8, 2016

*The day before Fronteers Conference 2016, Wednesday, October 5, we're hosting a set of full-day workshops. Today we are proud to announce the first confirmed workshop: A masterclass in responsive typography, with Zell Liew.*

Typography is tough. To create good typography for the Web, you need a combination of design chops and technical know-how, especially if you also want to keep your code base healthy and scalable.

[Zell Liew](/congres/2016/speakers) helps you out with a pre-conference masterclass on responsive typography. In his workshop on Wednesday, Zell will cover the practical ins and outs of advanced responsive typography, to give you a firm grasp of the principles of typography and how to apply them on the Web in responsive projects. You'll be better equipped to advise designers on the application of their conceptual designs.

There are 20 spots available for this workshop. Exclusive combo tickets will be made available through [our ticket shop](https://tickets.fronteers.nl): full Fronteers Conference 2016 access + Zell Liew workshop for €830 incl. VAT (or €650 incl. VAT for Fronteers members).

See the [Fronteers Conference 2016 Workshops page](/congres/2016/workshops) for all the info.
