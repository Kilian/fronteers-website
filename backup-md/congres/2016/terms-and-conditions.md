# Acceptance

By purchasing a ticket for the Fronteers Conference, you accept these Terms and Conditions in full.

# Pricing

All prices are subject to errors. Fronteers can not be held accountable due to any errors. All prices are in Euros and include 21% Dutch VAT, unless explicitly mentioned.

# Payment and ticket sales

Tickets are sold in three batches. The price of the ticket will stay the same throughout ticket sales. When you reserve a ticket, you will receive an e-mail with a confirmation link. You need to click on this link within 15 minutes to confirm your reservation. After your reservation has been confirmed, you have two weeks to make payment. After your reservation has been confirmed, you will gain access to a personal section of the ticket shop, where you can complete payment, download your invoice, and edit your details. It is possible to pay by creditcard (Mastercard and American Express), iDEAL, SOFORT Banking, Bancontact/Mister Cash, Belfius Direct Net and Bitcoin. If you haven't paid for the tickets within the specified term of two weeks, your reservation will expire.

# Conference tickets

A ticket to Fronteers Conference grants entrance to both days of the conference, lunch, coffee, tea and snacks, and access to the afterparty. Attendees are responsible for their own travel and accommodation.

# Member tickets

Fronteers members can buy a member ticket at a discounted price. Fronteers members who want to buy a discounted member ticket must already be a member when ticket sales are _announced_ and will receive a discount code by e-mail. Member tickets for the conference will be available as long as there are normal tickets for the conference available.

# Restitution

A ticket to either the conference or a workshop is final and non-refundable once paid for.

# Transfer of tickets

Conference and workshop tickets can be transferred. It is possible to [notify the organisation](/congres/2016/contact) of any changes to your registration up until two weeks before the conference or workshop. After that, tickets are still transferrable but the person who will attend in your place will get a badge with your name on it. Your request to change must include your email address and that of the person who will attend in your place. Member tickets can not be transferred to non-members.

# Selling or giving away tickets as part of promotions or sweepstakes

It is expressly forbidden to use Fronteers tickets as a prize in or a part of promotions or sweepstakes without consulting the Fronteers organisation. Any tickets found to be traded or acquired in such away will be made void and no restitution will be provided.

# Speakers and schedule

We try to do our utmost to create a great lineup with fantastic speakers. However, it is always possible that we have to change something at the last moment. Therefore all speakers and the schedule are subject to change without prior notice.

# Cancellation of the conference

We reserve the right to cancel conferences or events without prior notice. Should the conference be cancelled, Fronteers will fully refund your conference ticket.
