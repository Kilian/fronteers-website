     <h2>Jam Session · Fronteers Conference 2019</h2>
     <p>Starting out as a joke, the Fronteers Jam Session has become an event in its own right. Easily accessible, informal and compact, it is the moment to present a ten-minute &quot;lightning talk&quot; to an audience of conference attendees. The Fronteers Jam Session is an evening full of lightning talks to and from the community. From its conception, the Jam Session has served as an example of community events to conferences worldwide.<br>This year we are proud to announce...</p>

     <h3>Fronteers Jam Session X</h3>
     <p>It's the <strong>tenth</strong> edition of our event! (hence the <strong>X</strong>).</p>
     <p>Koen Willems and Job van Achterberg will curate a list of 10-minute-long, rip-roaring, rabble-rousing, front-ending lightning talks. Previous Jam Sessions were noisy, hot and steamy. This one might be too.</p>

     <h4>Talks, drinks and no music</h4>
     <p>This Thursday night, our event is held at the <a href="https://www.igc.nl">Koninklijke Industrieele Groote Club</a>, directly on the corner of Dam Square in the center of town. We're renting the entire building, so next to the Jam Session auditorium, we'll be hosting our familiar Thursday night social. We know many of you want to catch up with friends; we've opted out of background music.</p>

     <h3>This year's speakers</h3>
     <h4>'We're all desktop app developers now' by Kilian Valkhof</h4>
     <p>It used to be that building desktop apps was capital-H hard. You had to know &quot;Real Programming Languages&quot; and use either native code that only worked on one OS, or settle for cross-platform systems that were ...let's say &quot;not great&quot;.</p>
     <p>Well, that's changed. Everyone with the skills to build a website is now also a desktop app developer, and companies like Github, Microsoft, Slack and Atlassian are showing what that means.</p>
     <p>Kilian has developed half a dozen applications in Electron, the framework driving this new paradigm of using web technologies to make desktop applications. In his talk he'll explain how we got here, failed attempts from the past and how to actually get a cross-platform app up and running, all in the scope of 10 minutes!</p>
     <h4>'The Programming Rollercoaster' by Josee Wouters</h4>
     <p>Sometimes programming is fun and you feel like a winner. Sometimes programming is hard and you feel like a complete idiot.<br>And sometimes you're going back and forth between these emotions a couple of times a day.<br>Do you recognize yourself? Than this is for you.<br>Do you want to know how to survive this programming rollercoaster? How to stay motivated when the 'I'm an idiot'-feeling is more powerful? How can you silence your imposter syndrome?</p>
     <p>I'll teach you a couple of ways for dealing with these feelings, that work really well for me.<br>'You're not alone', is the message I want you to hear. Maybe my methods won't work for you, but at least you'll know you're not alone.</p>
     <h4>'What The Form?' by Rowdy Rabouw</h4>
     <p>Forms are a very important part of the web, but we manage to screw them up all the time. We confuse and frustrate users to a point it will even cost you money.</p>
     <p>Let's look at bad examples and improve them to give users a better experience and their sanity back.</p>
     <h4>'Server-Timing and User-Timing' by Anton Nemtsev</h4>
     <p>How to identify performance issues with real user measurements and W3C standards.</p>
     <h4>'Breaking barriers with your CMS' by Hidde de Vries</h4>
     <p>On the modern web, we can design content with the visual interestingness that we've always wanted. We can have beautiful pages <em>and</em> lots of variety. But how can we manage all that content, and maximise accessibility at the same time? In this talk, I will look at how your CMS can improve accessibility — both for content editors and for web users.</p>
     <h4>'JavaScript Yellow' by Bram(us) van Damme</h4>
     <p>A short tongue-in-cheek talk on how to obtain JavaScript Yellow and how you, as a JavaScript Developer, can use it in your projects.</p>
     <h4>'Things you didn't know about Images on the Web' by Christian &quot;Schepp&quot; Schaefer</h4>
     <p>You think you are a web veteran and so by now you know everything about using images on the web? Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that. My talk will feature a potpourri of very unusual techniques, centered around the use of images on the web. Some of them are stone old, some are bleeding edge, some are useful, and some are completly useless. And I bet, you don't even know half of them.</p>
     <h4>'How Studying History Of Arts Helped Me Become A Better Frontend Engineer' by Nils Binder</h4>
     <p>You may think, art history and frontend development do not have much in common. Well, you may be surprised.<br>Some of the problems we have to deal with today were discussed in art history long before the invention of the Internet. Also, the skills needed to analyze a piece of art correctly show significant similarity to the capabilities required to implement modern layouts with CSS. This talk will show you how to analyze a static layout by looking beyond pixels. Instead, you will understand why a given design works the way it does and translate this to modern CSS.</p>
     <h4>'Sharing cat gifs after the apocalypse' by Niels Leenheer</h4>
     <p>Do you ever wonder what will happen to our society when there is no internet anymore? How will we order take-away? Can we even find a restaurant without Google Maps? How will we let other people know what we are currently eating? And the biggest question of all, how will we share cat gifs?</p>
     <h4>'A crash course on web components' by Joël Kuijten</h4>
     <p>Web Components are natively supported in a large percentage of browsers. I'll try to run through the way they can be created and used. Share what shadow DOM, Custom Elements, ESM and Template's are and how they work together to enable ✨Web Components✨.</p>
     <h4>'Shrink an elephant into a fly' by Vadim Makeev</h4>
     <p>Markup, styles, and scripts got everything: specs, docs, multiple competing solutions, and clear best practice. 25 years later after img invention, graphics for the web is still witchcraft which is passed along as word of mouth. “My grandpa has been exporting JPEGs from Photoshop and lived for 100 years!” 15 years of experience in a single talk: from creation and exporting graphics to optimization and embedding.</p>
     <h4>'⍺β: A Bedtime Book on Performance' by Henri Helvetica</h4>
     <p>What could be better than learning about performance in 26 letters?? Exactly! ⍺β is a whimsical lightning talk about old and new performance related technologies, presented in a well illustrated.</p>
     <h4>'10 cliches and 10 misconceptions, in 10 minutes' by Paul van Buren</h4>
     <p>We have all heard them, the cliches that our managers and colleagues use. &quot;The home page is the most important page of the site&quot;, &quot;We have no blind users&quot;, &quot;We use an accessibility plugin&quot; and other cringeworthy cliches. Paul will kill them with fire.</p>
