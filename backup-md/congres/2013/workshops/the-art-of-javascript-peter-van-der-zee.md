# Learn the fine art of JavaScript

Learn the various aspects of JavaScript (or ECMAScript 5). We start with the simple structure of the language and end with the more complex nature of closures, context, and callbacks. We will explain every tiny bit of the language, from semicolon to prototype.

After this workshop you will have a solid understanding of how JavaScript works. This will be of great help in many different applications of JavaScript, such as libraries and their plug-ins, web ‘apps’ and whatnot.

Have you made things with jQuery, fiddled with JavaScript examples from the web, or have experience with another programming language ? Then this workshop is for you. Or, do you know your way around specific libraries and do you want to know more about the JS language itself? Than this workshop is also for you. This workshop will NOT teach you how to use jQuery or other libraries, but you will have a better understanding of them afterwards.
