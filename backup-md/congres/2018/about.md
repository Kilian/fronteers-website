title: About Fronteers Conference
---
Fronteers Conference is organised by volunteers of Fronteers, the Dutch professional association for front-end developers. Besides organising Fronteers Conference, the professional association also runs regular meet-ups and workshops and an online job board. Fronteers has roughly 500 members, mainly from The Netherlands. See also: [About Fronteers](/about).

As a volunteer organisation, we have more ideas than time. In order to deliver a smooth and professional conference, we continuously work together with third party partners for things like food, WiFi and logistics.
